Activity Sticker
================

This WP/BP Plugin is no more supported and this repository is now archived.

Activity Sticker is an experimental BuddyPress 1.7 plugin to make an activity update stick at the top of the Site Wide Activity Directory.

Once activated, the administrator of the community can :

+ Add a sticky update directly from the WordPress back end Activity area
+ Make an existing activity update, a new blog post activity or a new site wide forum “bbPress topic created” activity stick at the top.

You can watch a demo of the plugin on my vimeo [vimeo](http://vimeo.com/imath/activity-sticker)

Available in french and english.
